# Observer Setup
We have a OMonoBehaviour for listener. If we disable monobehaviour remove and we enable add event. If object will listener should inherence OMonoBehaviour. We haave helper static class as know Observer. Observer register all event system for transform, root and all game objects. 

# ObjectPool
We have basic Object Pool system. we will fill ObjectType enum and get object.
