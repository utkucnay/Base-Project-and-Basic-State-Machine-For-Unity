# Base Project and Basic AI System For Unity
 I made Base Project for all Unity Games

# Observer Setup
We have a ReciverMonoBehaviour for listener. If we disable monobehaviour remove and we enable add event. If object will listener should inherence ReciverMonoBehaviour. We have helper static class as know Observer. Observer register all event system for transform, root or all game objects. 

# ObjectPool
We have basic Object Pool system. we will fill ObjectType enum and get object.

# Singleton
It does what it says in name.

# Command
We create command like move, timer etc. and hold Command Queue.  

# Basic State Machine
We create state and transition like Unity animation.

# Unit Test
